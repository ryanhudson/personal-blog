# The Future of AI Agents

Artificial Intelligence is moving beyond simple chat interfaces. The next frontier is **Agency**.

## What are AI Agents?

Unlike passive models that wait for a prompt, agents can:
1. Perceive their environment
2. Make decisions
3. Take actions using tools

> "The future is not just about smarter models, but about models that can *do* things."

### The Stack

We are seeing a new stack emerge:
- **Orchestration:** LangChain, AutoGen
- **Memory:** Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Tools:** APIs, browsing capabilities

I'm currently experimenting with the Gemini API to build a personal research assistant that reads my emails and summarizes daily tech news.
